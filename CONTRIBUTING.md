# Contributing to Rollatorium

Thanks for your interest in improving Rollatorium!

Rollatorium is a small part of the larger Mettle Kettle project. As such, it doesn't currently have its own roadmap.

If you have an idea for how to make Rollatorium better, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/mettlekettle/rollatorium/issues) first to discuss how it fits in with future development plans.
